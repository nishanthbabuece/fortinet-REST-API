Here's a basic Python script to get inventory details from FortiManager using its REST API. 
This script assumes you have already configured access to FortiManager's REST API and have obtained the necessary authentication token. 
Replace "YOUR_API_TOKEN" with your actual API token and adjust the API endpoint URLs and parameters as needed based on your FortiManager configuration and the specific inventory details you want to retrieve.

This script sends a GET request to the FortiManager API to retrieve inventory details, including the name, serial number, model, and firmware version of each device managed by FortiManager. 
Make sure to replace "YOUR_API_TOKEN" with your actual API token.

Additionally, ensure that you have proper error handling, authentication mechanisms, and endpoint URLs configured according to your FortiManager setup.
